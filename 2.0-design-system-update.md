### 2.0 Design System Update
*   **Main Task Goal:** To create a consistent, accessible, and reusable set of visual components that will form the building blocks of the new design.

*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    *   **2.1 Define color palette (ensure contrast â‰¥4.5:1)**
        *   **What to do:** Choose a primary, secondary, and neutral color palette that aligns with the brand but also meets accessibility standards for text contrast.
        *   **What to prepare:** A color contrast checking tool.
        *   **What to complete:** A documented set of color codes (hex, RGB) with clear guidelines on their usage.
    *   **2.2 Standardize typography (Inter, 16pt min)**
        *   **What to do:** Establish a clear typographic hierarchy using the "Inter" font family. Define sizes for headings, body text (minimum 16pt), and labels.
        *   **What to prepare:** The Inter font file and typography best practices.
        *   **What to complete:** A defined type scale with font sizes, weights, and line heights documented.
    *   **2.3 Create reusable components**
        *   **What to do:** Design and build a core set of UI components that can be used throughout the app. This includes:
            *   **2.3.1 Form inputs:** Text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
            *   **2.3.2 Status badges:** Visual indicators for statuses like "Processing," "Approved," or "Rejected."
            *   **2.3.3 Progress stepper:** A component that shows users which step they are on in a multi-step process.
        *   **What to prepare:** UI design software (Figma) and the newly defined color and typography styles.
        *   **What to complete:** A library of reusable, named components in Figma.
    *   **2.4 Document in `docs/style-guide.md`**
        *   **What to do:** Add the new color palette, typography rules, and component examples to the project's official style guide.
        *   **What to prepare:** All the assets and guidelines created in sub-tasks 2.1-2.3.
        *   **What to complete:** An updated `docs/style-guide.md` file that serves as a single source of truth for the app's visual design.
