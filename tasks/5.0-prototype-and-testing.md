### 5.0 Prototype & Testing
*   **Main Task Goal:** To create an interactive simulation of the new design and validate its effectiveness with real users before development begins.

*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    *   **5.1 Build clickable prototype**
        *   **What to do:** Connect all the final design screens in Figma to create a realistic, interactive prototype. This must include:
            *   **5.1.1 Happy path (successful claim):** The ideal flow where a user successfully submits a claim without any errors.
            *   **5.1.2 Error recovery (document rejection):** A flow showing how a user is notified of a rejected document and how they can correct the error.
        *   **What to prepare:** All approved high-fidelity designs from Tasks 3.0 and 4.0.
        *   **What to complete:** A fully clickable and interactive prototype in Figma (`prototype/main.fig`).
    *   **5.2 Conduct usability tests with 5 users**
        *   **What to do:** Recruit five representative users and observe them as they attempt to complete key tasks using the prototype.
        *   **What to prepare:** A test plan and script with clear tasks for the users to perform.
        *   **What to complete:** Detailed notes, recordings, and a summary of feedback and issues encountered by the users.
    *   **5.3 Iterate based on feedback (max 2 cycles)**
        *   **What to do:** Analyze the feedback from the usability tests, identify the most critical issues, and refine the designs to address them. This process can be repeated up to two times.
        *   **What to prepare:** The usability test findings.
        *   **What to complete:** An updated version of the Figma prototype that incorporates user feedback.
