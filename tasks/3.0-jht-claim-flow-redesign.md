### 3.0 JHT Claim Flow Redesign
*   **Main Task Goal:** To streamline the JHT claim process, making it faster, easier, and less prone to errors for the user.

*   **Sub-Tasks:**
    *   **3.1 Simplify to 3-step process (Verify → Upload → Submit)**
        *   **What to do:** Restructure the entire claim flow into three clear and logical steps.
        *   **What to prepare:** The user journey map and pain points identified in the research phase (Task 1.0).
        *   **What to complete:** A user flow diagram and wireframes illustrating the new, simplified 3-step process.
    *   **3.2 Design auto-fill functionality for known data**
        *   **What to do:** Create designs that show how the application will automatically populate form fields with information it already has about the user (e.g., name, ID number).
        *   **What to prepare:** An understanding of what user data is available for auto-filling.
        *   **What to complete:** High-fidelity mockups of forms with pre-populated data.
    *   **3.3 Add inline validation with error prevention**
        *   **What to do:** Design form fields that give users real-time feedback as they type, confirming valid input or immediately flagging errors.
        *   **What to prepare:** A list of validation rules for common fields (e.g., email format, phone number length).
        *   **What to complete:** UI designs showing the different states of form fields: empty, active, valid, and invalid with error messages.
    *   **3.4 Implement document upload guidance (tooltips)**
        *   **What to do:** Design helpful tooltips or info icons next to each document upload field that clearly explain the requirements (e.g., "PDF only, max 5MB").
        *   **What to prepare:** A list of all required documents and their specific submission criteria.
        *   **What to complete:** Mockups of the document upload screen showing the guidance tooltips.
