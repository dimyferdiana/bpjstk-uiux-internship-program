    *   **1.5 Compile findings into `research/audit-report.md`**
        *   **What to do:** Combine all the insights from the interviews, personas, journey map, and accessibility audit into a single, comprehensive report.
        *   **What to prepare:** All completed documents from sub-tasks 1.1 through 1.4.
        *   **What to complete:** The final `research/audit-report.md` file that summarizes the research phase and provides clear direction for the redesign.
